  <p style="background-color:rgb(147, 103, 103); font-size: 19px;">Who am I, and what is this? 
    This is a website to explain to you the reader, who I am and what I do with my free time. Now, let’s start off with who I am. 
    Obviously my name is Alexander, but I have a more intricate past than most would think. I was born in Las Vegas Nevada but moved to New Mexico. 
    I will say, there’s not a lot for a child to do in New Mexico. So, I spend my hours skating, scootering, biking, and even on the trampoline. 
    I often went cliff jumping near my grandmother’s house, and when it snowed, I would sled down the steepest hills. 
    After moving to a more suburban part of New Mexico around second grade, my crave for adrenaline was amped. 
    I was constantly outside trying to find fun things that would get my blood pumping. I would explore the tangled underground tunnels that helped 
    with rainfall and climb trees on day’s where I could be outside for hours. My determination to defeat any fear I had in me was taking over, at this point
     I was undeniably a fearless kid. During my teenage years I would move to Pennsylvania with my father where I would have to leave behind all 
     my old trophies. I was now left with nothing, no skateboard, scooter, BMX bike, or a trampoline. From there I went through the stages of a kid
      where you get fat, grow a little and thin out, after I was a primed teenager. I was explosive with energy, and I needed to do something instead of
       sitting inside playing PlayStation (I was dirty.) So, I finally got another skateboard and was back at it. 
       I also got a snowboard, and this added another element to my talents. However, during this time I was also enrolled in a private school where I was 
       rigorously challenged academically and socially as I spend most my time by myself or with my siblings. This is where I had to put down the extreme 
       sports and try. It was difficult adjusting, however I used what I learned in my youth and overcame whatever challenged me. Entering my high school 
       years, I was forced to play a sport so I would stay active. With great intellect knowing I have little to no muscle on me as well as being 5’3 at 
       the time I chose to row. A year later, realizing that was one of my most regrettable decisions, I quit and started playing rugby where I figured my 
       athletic ability would be more useful. I was correct in this thinking, I won a reward for the best back (position) for our junior varsity team, then
        was promoted to play varsity the end of my sophomore, junior, and senior year. I may be small, but I’m shifty and quick as well as having great hand
         eye coordination from being a demon with a controller. Our team was so good that during my time playing varsity, our varsity team was invited to play
          in New Orleans as well as Ireland. During this era where I was at my peak athletic ability, durability, and stamina, I was also the most engulfed in 
          skating and snowboarding. I was learning new tricks almost every week, hitter bigger spots every time all the way up to a 9 stair
           (Probably my biggest accomplishment as an 18-year-old.) </p>

<!--Adding this video was pretty difficult, i first had to find the code for it. I still dont understand what the point in repeting the source part. Maybe incase you have two different file versions of the viedo. Speaking of, that was another problem I had. HTML only supports 3 differnt kind of viedo files not including the ".mov" witch is the file your given when texting your self a video. So, after finding a file converter online it finally worked. However the play button just does not work so i had to impute the autoplay and even then it only plays one time. So I added a note in my writing to zoom in and refresh the page so you can actualy see it. One more thing, when dealing with the width and height, the height makes the video larger, but its already auto scaled. This means that the length just moves it left and right and that way the video will not get distorted. Another side note, I just found out you can loop a video so I no longer need to tell the online reader to refresh the page to watch the video.-->
   
  
  <p style="background-color:rgb(147, 103, 103);">After all this time of skating, snowboarding, flipping, scootering, and biking, I had never gotten hurt besides a bruise.
     <p style="background-color:rgb(147, 103, 103);"><img src="Rugby with boys.JPG" alt="Me and my friends during our Ierland tour" style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%;"> 
      But everyone knows that nothing good lasts forever, rugby put me out of commission my senior year.
       I first got a concussion at the end of the first season, so I could not skate or play video games. Then, 2 weeks into being cleared to play again,
        I broke my hand during practice. Luckily it wasn’t a horrible break, and within three weeks I got it off but was recommended not to play because 
        the bone was fragile. However, I found a love for rugby and was eager to play again already missing three weeks of the season. Also, I got my cast
         off 2 days before our flight to Ireland, so I had to play. I was fine throughout the whole trip, of course I felt the effects of having a weak forearm.
          But, I powered through and played my heart out. After this, the very same week we got back, I sprained my ankle. This was one injury that was always
           so prone to happen from skating but never did. This one really hurt my sole; this is because I couldn’t skate anymore. I had hurt my left ankle which 
           was the one I used to flick/ drag. It was one of the most important aspects of skating, and when it still hurt to land on after 6 months. 
           I almost gave up skating. But that’s not who I am, I did ankle strength training and therapy every day on YouTube. 
           Until finally I was able to painlessly skate again. At this point it had been so long that I had lost so much balance, drop durability, and a few tricks.
            This one hurt the ego as well, I was not as good as before but that brings me to the present. I have been skating at least 4 times a 
            week since welcome week of college. This is where I’m at now ⬇️.</p></p>

    In today’s world, speakers are used everywhere and by everyone, twenty-four-seven. However, people often use speakers solely to enhance the sound they want to hear without recognizing the hidden properties that speakers and music carry with them. I have discovered that my artifact—speakers—can also have an effect on plants when combined with music. This realization further enriches their significance in our community. For this reason, people should be more accepting of speakers instead of clinging to the stigma surrounding them. Furthermore, I believe humans should incorporate music through speakers into their everyday lives because of its positive effects. This shows that speakers are a positive influence on life, and we should embrace them rather than avoid them.

    I want to address the stigma around speakers. They are often perceived as annoying, too loud, and associated with delinquents. While this perception can sometimes be accurate, it reflects more on the individuals using them than the speakers themselves. For example, even if an eighty-year-old woman owns a speaker, you would not expect her to walk down the street blasting Elvis Presley. A similar analogy can be drawn with guns: as people say, “Guns do not kill people; people kill people.” However, there is always the counterargument that someone pulled the trigger. The same logic applies to speakers, someone must press the play button to use them obnoxiously. Even though I have experienced the annoyance with improper speaker usage, I want people to move past this annoyance. While I acknowledge that speakers can be disruptive in certain situations, such as when someone is trying to sleep or study, when used properly, they enhance relaxation and enjoyment. Music, for example, is an excellent tool for relaxation, even though the type of music matters. Personally, rap music relaxes me, even though some people may find it vulgar or inappropriate. My point is that while speakers can sometimes be bothersome, nevertheless they can also bring immense joy and comfort.
    Speakers alone are powerful devices, as they have been proven to relax the human mind. When combined with music, the effects they can produce are incredible. “The same brain-chemical system that enables feelings of pleasure from sex, recreational drugs, and food is also critical to experiencing musical pleasure… Music can relax the body because brain waves are able to synchronize with the rhythm of a song. People’s moods can reflect what they choose to listen to” (Heshmat). This statement highlights how music activates the brain’s chemical system, literally making you feel good. Additionally, it helps relax the body, which is crucial for mental health, especially given the high-stress levels experienced by younger generations. In my encomium essay, I discussed a related effect tied to the frequency of sounds: “The data suggests that 432 Hz-tuned music can decrease heart rate” (Calamassi and Pomponi). Now imagine combining these effects. Just as one plus one equals two, decreasing heart rate with 432 Hz-tuned music and relaxing the body through brain wave synchronization creates an even more profound calming effect. Relaxing music is not just a matter of opinion—it is backed by science. While personal preference does play a role, listeners simply need to find a song they like that propagates 432 Hz for optimal relaxation.
    Another hidden property of music is its effect on plant life. Like humans, plants also experience stress. When plants are stressed, their growth slows. But what happens when they are “unstressed” or relaxed? A study conducted by Anindita Chowdhury and Anshu Gupta reveals the results. “Growth rate in terms of height and biomass, respectively, increased by 20% and 72% when treated with classical music, i.e., raga music played on Indian musical instruments like flute, violin, and harmonium. A similar positive effect was observed in field crops—like size increment in the range of 25% to 60% above other regional crops” (Chowdhury and Gupta). As shown, plants also experience the positive effects of music. I love having plants around my dorm because they remind me of home; my mother always kept plants throughout our house. However, my dorm only has one window, so my plants often struggle to survive. Over the past few weeks, I have been playing classical music while studying and doing homework, and I have noticed that my plants have started growing again. This gives me, and other plant lovers, an additional reason to listen to music daily.
    Now, to my main point, that people should be more accepting of speakers and use them in their daily lives, as they can improve mental health. Stress is one of the leading causes of poor mental health and depression. In today’s world, stress has overtaken my generation and is crippling us. “In 2024, 43% of adults say they feel more anxious than they did the previous year, up from 37% in 2023 and 32% in 2022… Additionally, 71% of adults feel that children and teens have more mental health problems than they did 10 years ago” (Connors). Now that we see how severe stress levels are, I can share my part of the solution. As I mentioned earlier, finding a 432 Hz-tuned song you enjoy can be one of the most relaxing experiences. If people create playlists of these songs and listen to them for even ten minutes a day, they will notice reduced stress levels. I have personally tested this by listening to 432 Hz classical music while studying and doing homework. Recently, I have noticed that I worry less about other things, and my concentration on my work improves. After completing my tasks, I no longer feel plagued by thoughts about the uselessness of homework. Instead, I feel more energized and less like a “college zombie.” Ultimately, by combining music and speakers, people can improve their mental health by reducing stress and promoting relaxation.
    In conclusion, speakers are capable of benefiting both humans and plants by promoting relaxation and fostering healthier mental well-being and plant growth. Although they are sometimes stigmatized as obnoxious or intrusive, it is clear that when used thoughtfully, speakers are a helpful tool to humanity. For these reasons, speakers should be integrated into our daily lives to enhance mental health and create a more peaceful environment for all living things. Since their impact depends on how they are used, we should embrace their positive potential and move past the stigma surrounding it. It is time to let go of this stereotype around speakers and harness the hidden benefits of music and sound to build a healthier, more harmonious world.

<!-- Here is the audience analisis- My audience is mostly to my parents because they often tell me about how they don’t like when I play my music in the shower. However, it is also to the people in the world that think speakers are, “overrated,” such as my sister as she prefers headphones. In this writing I prove how useful they are not just to one person but to the whole world. My audience is well acquainted with technology; however, they are more social people. Meaning that they are not on their phones or watching TV as much as a young adult would. My encomium shows them the true capabilities of speakers with facts and examples.-->
